description: Evening. Did you do it? Yes or no.
---

## Context

Read silently: CLAUDE.md, today's journal, today's commitment from commitments.md.

## Ask

"Did you do it?"

Wait. Let them answer yes or no first.

## Update

### If YES:
1. Update commitments.md: mark Done = Yes
2. Add to wins.md if it's a real ship (not just busy work)
3. Update journal with what happened

### If NO:
Ask: "What got in the way?" (one sentence)

1. Update commitments.md: mark Done = No, add their reason
2. Update journal

Don't comfort. Don't lecture. Just record.

## Pattern check

If same excuse 3+ times across commitments.md:
"'[excuse]' keeps showing up. Is this real or are you avoiding?"

## Close

- If yes: "Shipped. Rest."
- If no: "Tomorrow. Same thing or different?"

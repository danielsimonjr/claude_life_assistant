---

## Context

Read silently:
- CLAUDE.md (About Me and Now)
- commitments.md (this week's entries)
- projects.md (check for fading)
- wins.md (this week's wins)
- journal/ (this week's entries)

## The Review

Present the data, then ask:

### 1. Commitments

"Here's what you committed to this week:"

[List from commitments.md]

"You hit X out of Y. Here's the gap:"

[List misses with their stated reasons]

### 2. Patterns

If same excuse appears 2+ times: "You said '[excuse]' twice. What's really going on?"

If same commitment missed 2+ times: "You've avoided [X] multiple times. Either do it Monday or drop it."

### 3. Projects

Check projects.md for anything not touched in 7+ days.

"[Project] hasn't been touched since [date]. Is it dead or are you reviving it this week?"

### 4. Wins

"You shipped: [list from wins.md]"

If no wins: "No wins logged. Did you ship anything?"

### 5. Next Week

"What's the ONE thing for next week?"

Update Now section with their answer.

## Close

No cheerleading. Just:
- "That's the week. Go."
- Or if rough: "Rough week. What's different next week?"
